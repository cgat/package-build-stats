## Fork

This is a fork of [package-build-stats](https://github.com/pastelsky/package-build-stats) that adds support for building stats locally. When this [PR](https://github.com/pastelsky/package-build-stats/pull/16) (hopefully) is merged, this repo will no longer be needed.

This is the function that powers the core of building, minifying and gzipping of packages in bundlephobia.

## Installation

`npm i package-build-stats-local`

## Usage (Fork)

```js
const getBuiltPackageStats = require('package-build-stats-local')

getBuiltPackageStats('packageName|pathToLocalPackage', {
  options,
}).then(result => console.log(result))
```

## Options

| Option             | Values            | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| client             | `'npm' or 'yarn'` | Which client to use to install package for building                                                                                                             |
| limitConcurrency   | `true` or `false` | When using `yarn` as the client, use the network mutex to limit concurrency                                                                                     |
| networkConcurrency | `number`          | When using `yarn` as client, limit simultaneous installs to this number.                                                                                        |
| customImports      | `Array<string>`   | By default, the default export is used for calculating sizes. Setting this option allows calculation of package stats based on more granular top-level exports. |

## Testing results using in-built server in development

### Commands

To start an local server that builds packages, run -

```bash
yarn run start
```

The server runs at port `3000`.

### Making requests

To build a package and get it's stats, run a curl request like so -

```bash
curl 'localhost:3000/size?p=<package-name>'
```

eg.

```bash
curl 'localhost:3000/size?p=react'
```

## Contributing

Clone the repo, npm install, and run the server.
